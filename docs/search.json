    "section": "Choosing a Topic",
    "text": "Choosing a Topic\n\nScope\nThe expected statistical level aligns with modern methods covered in advanced textbooks (e.g. Chernozhukov et al. 2024; Gaillac and L’Hour 2025; Wager 2024). Projects based on recent papers are also welcome if they are feasible within the course timeframe.\nYou are free to choose a topic from any branch of statistics:\n\nCausal inference;\nPrediction;\nInference.\n\nThe question of your project does not have to be groundbreaking, as the emphasis is more on the technical soundness. However, I would still recommend trying more “modern” things, as these will likely provide more learning value and relevance to your future work.\n\n\nWhat Makes a Good Topic?\nA strong project topic is specific and follows this pattern:\n\nOne (or more) method(s) are evaluated in one (or more) scenario(s) to answer a specific question.\n\nA few simple examples to help explain the idea:\n\nEvaluating the Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) estimator.\n\n\nQuestion: Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) estimator is designed to estimate average treatment effects in settings with staggered treatment timing and heterogeneous effects. How does it perform in terms of bias and variance across different sample sizes and treatment effect distributions?\nApproach: simulate data with varying sample sizes, treatment effect heterogeneity, and treatment patterns. Tabulate bias, variance, and coverage rates.\n\n\nEfficiency Loss: Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) vs. Two-Way Fixed Effects\n\n\nQuestion: In settings where the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator is consistent, how much efficiency is lost by using the Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) estimator instead?\nApproach: Design DGPs where TWFE is consistent (e.g. no staggered adoption). Vary sample sizes, treatment effect distributions, and error structures to quantify efficiency trade-offs.\n\n\nBias in Cross-Validation for Model Selection\n\n\nQuestion: Cross-validation (CV) is the de facto standard for model selection in predictive settings. However, CV is inherently biased, as \\(K\\)-fold CV gives an unbiased estimator for the performance of the algorithm when faced with share \\((K-1)/K\\) of the training data. However, the final selected algorithm gets retrained on the full dataset. How large is the bias in risk, and does model selection based on biased risk estimates lead to meaningfully worse predictive performance?\nApproach: Simulate prediction tasks with varying signal-to-noise ratios, sample sizes, and model complexities. For a given sample size \\(N\\), compare cross-validation-based model selection based to selection based on a new validation sample of size \\(N\\).",

    "text": "Format\n\nGroup Work\nGroup formation:\n\nYou will work in groups of three students.\nForm your groups independently, but notify the instructor if you need help finding teammates.\n\nThe key component of the project phase is group meetings. These meetings will by default take place during lecture hours. Every group should meet with the instructor at least once every two weeks. The sign-up details will be provided on eCampus.\nThese meetings are your opportunity to:\n\nDiscuss progress and challenges.\nGet feedback on your project direction.\nFigure our directions for improvement.\n\nThe general idea is to rapidly iterate on the project based on the feedback and discussions in the meetings.\nOpen-ended technical projects often evolve as you work on them. Be prepared for a continuous learning process, including:\n\nRefining your code and simulation design (e.g. implementation, refactoring).\nDeepening your understanding of statistical methods and their real-world context.\nLearning more technical tools as challenges arise.\nAdjusting your evaluation approach as needed.\nShifting scope if earlier approaches prove ineffective.\n\nCollaboration within your group is key.\nYou can think of this stage as an agile (learning) experience:\n\nRegular check-ins to assess progress.\nRapid adjustments based on feedback.\nLearning just what you need for the next step.\nCollaborating on both technical work and knowledge sharing.\n\nThe aim is to produce a final project that reflects your learning and iteration throughout the course.\n\n\nTerm Paper\n\nLength: Maximum 20 pages (excluding bibliography and appendix).\n\nNote: 20 pages is an upper limit, not a target. Focus on clarity and conciseness.\n\nFormatting: Use 12pt font, 1.5-line spacing, and 2.5 cm margins.\nAppendix: Use for long tables, additional figures, or supplementary material.\n\n\n\nReplication Code\n\nSubmit your code as a GitHub repository (private or public). Add the instructor as a collaborator using their institutional email, if using a private repo.\nInclude all files necessary for full replication, along with a README with clear instructions.",
