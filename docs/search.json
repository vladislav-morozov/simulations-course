    "text": "The course project is the cornerstone of your learning experience in this module. Its key objective is to evaluate a statistical method (or a set of related methods) through Monte Carlo simulations. Students are required to design, execute, and analyze simulations to assess the method’s performance in a given context.\nThe project is designed to help you develop three key skills:\n\nDesigning and interpreting simulations to evaluate statistical methods.\nOrganizing and sharing technical work in a reproducible and professional manner.\nCommunicating findings effectively through writing and presentations.\n\nYour grade for the course will be based entirely on this project. For deadlines, group sign-ups, and submission details, please refer to eCampus.\nBroadly, the project involves the following key steps:\n\nMethod selection: choose a method\nSimulation design: develop and implement simulations to evaluate the method’s properties (e.g., bias, variance, coverage, efficiency, model selection abilities, etc.) across relevant scenarios.\nAnalysis and interpretation: analyze simulation results and discuss their implications.\nDocumentation: produce a term paper and deliver a presentation, accompanied by fully reproducible code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expected statistical level aligns with modern methods covered in advanced textbooks (e.g. Chernozhukov et al. 2024; Gaillac and L’Hour 2025; Wager 2024). Projects based on recent papers are also welcome if they are feasible within the course timeframe.\nYou are free to choose a topic from any branch of statistics:\n\nCausal inference;\nPrediction;\nInference.\n\nThe question of your project does not have to be groundbreaking, as the emphasis is more on the technical soundness. However, I would still recommend trying more “modern” things, as these will likely provide more learning value and relevance to your future work.\n\n\n\nA strong project topic is specific and follows this pattern:\n\nOne (or more) method(s) are evaluated in one (or more) scenario(s) to answer a specific question.\n\nA few simple examples to help explain the idea:\n\nEvaluating the Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) estimator.\n\n\nQuestion: Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) estimator is designed to estimate average treatment effects in settings with staggered treatment timing and heterogeneous effects. How does it perform in terms of bias and variance across different sample sizes and treatment effect distributions?\nApproach: simulate data with varying sample sizes, treatment effect heterogeneity, and treatment patterns. Tabulate bias, variance, and coverage rates.\n\n\nEfficiency Loss: Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) vs. Two-Way Fixed Effects\n\n\nQuestion: In settings where the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator is consistent, how much efficiency is lost by using the Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) estimator instead?\nApproach: Design DGPs where TWFE is consistent (e.g. no staggered adoption). Vary sample sizes, treatment effect distributions, and error structures to quantify efficiency trade-offs.\n\n\nBias in Cross-Validation for Model Selection\n\n\nQuestion: Cross-validation (CV) is the de facto standard for model selection in predictive settings. However, CV is inherently biased, as \\(K\\)-fold CV gives an unbiased estimator for the performance of the algorithm when faced with share \\((K-1)/K\\) of the training data. However, the final selected algorithm gets retrained on the full dataset. How large is the bias in risk, and does model selection based on biased risk estimates lead to meaningfully worse predictive performance?\nApproach: Simulate prediction tasks with varying signal-to-noise ratios, sample sizes, and model complexities. For a given sample size \\(N\\), compare cross-validation-based model selection based to selection based on a new validation sample of size \\(N\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will work in groups of three students. Form your groups independently, but notify the instructor if you need help finding teammates.\n\n\n\n\n\nLength: Maximum 20 pages (excluding bibliography and appendix).\n\nNote: 20 pages is an upper limit, not a target. Focus on clarity and conciseness.\n\nFormatting: Use 12pt font, 1.5-line spacing, and 2.5 cm margins.\nAppendix: Use for long tables, additional figures, or supplementary material.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit your code as a GitHub repository (private or public). Add the instructor as a collaborator using their institutional email, if using a private repo.\nInclude all files necessary for full replication, along with a README with clear instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour final grade will be based on two components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nWeight\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nMethod Description\n15%\nClearly describe the method, its context, and key contributions from the literature.\n\n\nWriting Quality\n25%\nWrite in a clear and structured manner. State explicitly what question your simulation project is answering.\n\n\nCode Organization and Replicability\n25%\nWrite modular, well-documented, and easy to replicate code.\n\n\nSimulation Design\n20%\nDesign data-generating processes that are informative and relevant to the question.\n\n\nAnalysis and Interpretation\n15%\nRigorously interpret simulation results.
