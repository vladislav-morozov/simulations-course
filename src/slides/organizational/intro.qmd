## Content and Motivation {background="#00100F"}

#### About Me
 
**Instructor**: JProf. Dr. Vladislav Morozov

- Institute of Finance and Statistics
- Email: <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">morozov@uni-bonn.de</p>
- I work on practical statistical methods with a focus on unobserved heterogeneity

 

### This Course {background="#43464B"}



#### Example Questions
  
Evaluating and using new statistical methods involves questions like  

<div class="left-color">

- How well does a new causal inference method estimate the effect of interest? 
- Does an ML algorithm generalize well?
- Is hypothesis test A more powerful than test B?
- What is the real coverage of a given nominally 95% confidence interval? 

</div>

#### Limits of Theory

Sometimes can answer theoretically using some combination of

- Non-asymptotic analysis
- Parametric assumptions

. . .

<br>

But theory often not satisfactory (loose bounds, restrictive assumptions, intractable math)

#### Place of Simulations


<div class="rounded-box">

<span class="highlight">Simulations offer the next best thing</span>: can check every aspect of performance in controlled "lab" settings

</div>


- Using synthetic data: can control every part of data generating process
- Synthetic data $\Rightarrow$ full knowledge of target quantities, unlike with real data — esp. critical for causal methods



If data-generating process is chosen "well", <span class="highlight">informative</span> about performance on real data
 


#### Course Contents

Course covers essentials you need to write your own simulations:

- Metrics for evaluating estimators (causal and predictive), tests, confidence sets
- Structuring code
- Selecting DGPs

After end of lectures: putting things in practice with a project

#### This Course and the Research Module

This course — part of <span class="highlight">Research Module in Econometrics and Statistics</span>

- Preparation for writing a successful master's thesis in DS-adjacent topics (and beyond)
- At Bonn Econ a "typical" MSc thesis in DS involves simulations: critically evaluating an existing method (or a new method for more advanced theses)


<div class="left-color">

Need to know how to write simulations

## Course Logistics {background="#00100F"}


### Organization and Evaluations {background="#43464B"}

#### Course Format

Two parts of class: 

- Lectures on simulations: towards the beginning of the term
- Project development: you work on the projects and we have group-level meetings

. . .

<br>

Active questions encouraged! Also feel free to approach me after/before class or use office hours

#### Meeting Times

Class times:

- Wednesdays 16:00-18:00, Room 0.042
- Fridays 08:30-10:00, Room 0.042

<br>

<div class="rounded-box">

Any modifications will be announced on eCampus and in class

</div>


#### Evaluations

<div class="rounded-box">

Course grade is based on project

</div>

- Project: creating, running and evaluating simulations for a given statistical method
- Groups of $\leq 3$ people
- Submittable materials: term paper, public presentation, simulation code
- See course web for more details

- Course designed to be self-contained regarding simulations
- Very few books exist that discuss the topic
