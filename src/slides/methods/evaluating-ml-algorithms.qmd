## Introduction {background="#00100F"}

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from itertools import product

from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

BG_COLOR = "whitesmoke"
```

### Lecture Info {background="#43464B"}

#### Learning Outcomes

This lecture is about evaluating machine learning algorithms

<br>

By the end, you should be able to

 

- Understand 

### Lecture Example: Dealing with Class Imbalance {background="#43464B"}

#### Problem of Class Imbalance in Classification

Setting of today: classification with class imbalance

<br>

Empirically know that class imbalance may cause bias towards the majority classes, leading to

- Poor generalization
- Misleading accuracy metrics
- Potentially incorrect policy recommendations


#### Example Datasets With Different Imbalances

::: {.nonincremental}

- Two class example
- Each row: progressively stronger class imbalance

:::

```{python}
N_ROWS = 3
N_COLS = 4
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=N_ROWS, ncols=N_COLS, figsize=(16,5))
fig.patch.set_color(BG_COLOR)
for row_id, col_id in product(range(N_ROWS), range(N_COLS)):
    X, y = make_classification(
      n_samples=300,
      n_features=2,
      n_redundant=0,
      weights=[0.95 - 0.4*(N_ROWS - 1 - row_id)/(N_ROWS-1), 0.05 + 0.4*(N_ROWS - 1 - row_id)/(N_ROWS-1)],
      class_sep=1.7,
      flip_y=0.05,
      random_state= 67*row_id + 237*col_id
    )
    axs[row_id, col_id].scatter(X[y==1, 0], X[y==1, 1], color='gold', marker='x')
    axs[row_id, col_id].scatter(X[y==0, 0], X[y==0, 1], color='#3c165c')
    axs[row_id, col_id].set_xticks([]) 
    axs[row_id, col_id].set_yticks([]) 
```


#### Solutions to Class Imbalance

There are some solutions:

- Undersampling majority classes (throwing away data)
- Oversample minority classes (possibly with synthetic examples)
- Biasing algorithms towards minority classes by modifying training (e.g. weights in objective functions)

Which of these are better?

#### Goal of Today: Evaluating Solutions

Today:

Compact simulation in low-dimensional setting comparing

- Not doing anything
- Synthetic oversampling
- Weights in objective function

## Theory Essentials for Evaluating ML Algorithms {background="#00100F"}
  
### Core Concepts {background="#43464B"}

#### Goal of Statistical/Machine Learning


<div class="rounded-box">

Key goal of prediction --- predicting <span class="highlight">well</span>

</div> 

Other goals:

- Computational efficiency: better to have a cheaper and quicker way to produce a new prediction
- Interpretability: why does the algorithm predict what it does?
- Scalability: can it handle increasing loads, run in distributed manner, etc


#### Loss and Risk

Quality of prediction measured with *risk* function

Let $h(\bX)$ be a prediction of $Y$ given $\bX$  (<span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>) 


<div class="rounded-box">

 

Let the <span class="highlight">loss function </span>$l(y, \hat{y})$ satisfy $l(y, \hat{y})\geq 0$ and $l(y, y)=0$ for all $y, \hat{y}$.


The <span class="highlight">risk function</span> of the hypothesis (prediction) $h(\cdot)$ is the expected loss:
$$
R(h) = \E_{(Y, \bX)}\left[ l(Y, h(\bX))  \right]
$$


 


</div>


 
#### Interpretation: Generalization Error

<div class="rounded-box">

Risk measures how well the hypothesis $h$ performs on unseen data --- <span class="highlight">generalization error</span>  

</div>

Example: indicator risk:
$$
\E[\I\curl{Y\neq h(\bX)}] = P(Y\neq h(\bX))
$$
Probability of incorrectly predicting $Y$ with $h(\bX)$ --- where $Y$ and $\bX$ are a new observation


#### Components of a Setting

A predictive problem is defined by

- DGP
- Risk function
- Class $\Hcal$ of hypotheses
- Some decision rule (algorithm) that selects an $\hat{h}\in\Hcal$ after seeing data

As always, I suggest that you play with the code, add your own algorithms and see the effects
