### Lecture Info {background="#43464B"}

#### Learning Outcomes

This lecture is about making our code execute many simulation scenarios

#### Motivating Question for Simulation

<div class="left-color">

When testing multiple hypotheses in a regression, why do we use simultaneous (joint) tests instead of just adjusting the $p$-values from separate $t$-tests?

### Tests and Test Statistics {background="#43464B"}


#### Example: Wald Test


#### Example: Multiple $t$-Test

## Simulating Hypothesis Test Performance {background="#00100F"}
 

#### Technique: Reference Scenario

Today: trying to understand something 

Try to include a "reference" nice scenario

and vary something 


#### Effects for DGP


#### Aside: On Code Structure

Will keep using the code structure developed in 

actually many DGPs from one class. Creation of multiple things — handled by `scenarios.py`

Now have a larger array of simulation results.
