## Role of Monte Carlo Simulations {background="#00100F"}

#### What's The Point of Statistics?


<div class = .left-color>

Developing new methods that allow to learn things from data

</div>

What's interesting -- depends on the context, problem of the consumer of the method

#### 

So what do consumers of the methods want? 

<div class = .left-color>

Things that work well

</div>


Consumers want to know if the methods actually work

#### What's Well?

Modern understanding 


<div class = .left-color>

Guarantees that will work under a variety of settings
</div>


- We don't love parametric assumptions very much anymore, especially in social settings
- Results can be probabilitistic

- Sometimes can prove

not everything can be simulated (images, text)

Or some models may also be intractable to train more than a few times
