# Fundamentals of Monte Carlo Simulations in Data Science



![Course header image](src/images/sim-header.png) 
 




Learning the practice of Monte Carlo simulations in data science (offered as part of the Research Module in Econometrics and Statistics). 

## Motivation

How do we know if a new causal inference method actually estimates the effects of interest? Does a machine learning algorithm generalize well across different sample sizes? What happens when a statistical tool is applied outside its original setting?

Simulations provide answers to such questions. These "laboratories" of econometrics and statistics allow us to test methods in controlled environments, building confidence in their real-world applicability.

This research module focuses on the design, implementation, and interpretation of Monte Carlo simulations. It prepares students to write a rigorous master's thesis in econometrics and statistics, while equipping them with the skills to critically evaluate methods in diverse data science contexts, applied and theoretical. The focus is mainly practical and numerical, with the in-class simulations built in Python.
